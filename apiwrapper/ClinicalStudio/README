In this project we write an API wrapper that writes to the ClinicalStudio EDC. The wrapper:

1) Waits for a POST from the EDC to push a PDF object
2) Converts the pdf into text and pushes it into the insert route (if there isnt one then create one)
3) Calls ApysAPI for each CRF field based on patient ID, visit number
2) Authenticates and writes to the appropriate CRFs

-We need a place to write linkback so figure out with Paul where that should happen
-Plan with Paul as to how they plan to send the PDF
-We need a place to write the "recall" table so figure out where that should happen & implement it

-We will want the wrapper in JS because the ClinicalStudio API uses callbacks
